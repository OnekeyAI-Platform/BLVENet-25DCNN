# BLVENet: A 2.5D End to End Brain Volume Increase Prediction Network

The innovations presented in this study can be summarized as follows:

1. We propose an end-to-end model for **b**rain **l**esion **v**olume **e**nlargement which is called BLVENet. Our model combines the capability of 2D transfer learning and captures 3D spatial information to the maximum extent by extracting lesion context frames. Additionally, the model integrates clinical features in an end-to-end manner, further enhancing its predictive ability.
2. We compare BLVENet with classical 2D neural network models and find that BLVENet outperforms 2D DCNN, showing superior performance.
3. In terms of model interpretability, we introduce Grad-CAM and SHAP Value to conduct explainability analysis of the deep learning model, exploring the clinical value of BLVENet's predictive results.

In summary, our study introduces a novel end-to-end 2.5D radiomics model that incorporates robust feature selection, high interpretability, and clinical usability. These advancements contribute to improved prediction in the context of the specific task.
